# To Do List

A Javascript project in which I have learned to add a new item on a list. This was a small part of a tutorial that I have followed which  led to creating the Poke Time App.

## To start the project:

- Install and start the app:

  - `clone the repo`
  - `cd into the folder`
  - `run npm install`
  - `npm start`

## Technologies used:

- JavaScript
